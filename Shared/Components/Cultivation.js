            Tending a cannabis garden can be as easy or as difficult as you have the desire to make it. To make the best choices its good to know some basics about the cannabis species and how cannabis is categorized.
            <strong class="white">Phenotype</strong>
            Cannabis is the genus of the plant commonly used for its psychoactive effects in modern times. Cannabis is often categorized as "Sativa" or "Indica". This perceived difference comes from some characteristics of the psychoactive effects.
            
            In order to clear up some confusion around the two <strong class="white">"types"</strong> of cannabis, it is important to know that many modern cultivars are bred with plants from around the world. The genetic growth characteristics could come from a multitude of parents far back in a plants lineage.
            
            This means that <strong class="white">"Sativa"</strong> plants are often associated with tall and over long blooming periods. However, the distinction is not so clear between the two types.
            
            <strong class="white">"Indica"</strong> plants are believed to grow short and stout and perform well in cold weather This is an over-simplification as some tall plants do well in overly cold environments while some short ones do not.
          
            What is important to remember about this is that the types allow for a categorization of psychoactive effects amongst users providing a common language about the products of cannabis cultivation.
           
            <strong class="white">"Indica"</strong> effects are considered to be relaxing and slow a user down providing anxiety relief.
            
            <strong class="white">"Sativa"</strong> effects are considered to be more euphoric, energetic, and anxiety inducing.
            
            <strong class="white">"Hybrid"</strong> effects are the result of the aforementioned mash of lineages.
     
            The important fact I have come to learn is that each plant will respond according to the genetics its parents provide it with. its prior lineage and phenotype will determine the possible outcomes and only having grown a plant to fruition would a grower truly know how a specific <strong class="white">"phenotype"</strong> grows and what quality of flower it provides.
       
            This means that determining outcomes is not as cut and dry as "Sativa" and "Indica" as the genetic  origins of the plant you obtain may well have physical and psychoactive characteristics of either.
     
            Often with the help of websites such as
            <a class="white" href="https://en.seedfinder.eu/" target="_blank">SeedFinder</a>
            we can look back through the known data of lineages and determine some characteristics of plants we come across.
