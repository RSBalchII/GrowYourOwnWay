                    1. Germination stage:
                </strong>
                This involves the initial sprouting of the seed. The seed is soaked in water or planted directly into soil until it sprouts.

                <strong class="orange">
                    2. Vegetative stage:
                </strong>
                    During this stage, the plant develops its leaves, stems, and roots. This stage can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the strain and growing conditions.

                <strong class="orange">
                    3. Flowering stage:
                </strong>
                    In this stage, the plant begins to produce buds and flowers. This stage typically lasts around 8-10 weeks and is when the plant begins to produce the psychoactive compounds that are associated with cannabis use.

                    4. Harvesting and drying:
                </strong>
                    Once the plant has matured, it is harvested and dried before it can be consumed or processed further. The timing of harvesting can vary depending on the desired effect and the strain being grown.
