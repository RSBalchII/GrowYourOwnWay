                        The mature cannabis plant consists of several key components, each serving a distinct purpose.
                        <strong>
                            Here is a short summary of these components:

                                The flowers or buds of the cannabis plant contain the highest concentrations of cannabinoids, the most well known being

                                   THC(tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD(cannabidiol)

                              These compounds are responsible for the plant's psychoactive and therapeutic effects and there are actually nearly 100 compounds with medicinal use value in smaller proportion in commonly available cannabis.

                               </strong>
                                Cannabis leaves are typically characterized by their jagged,finger-like leaflets. While they contain lower concentrations of cannabinoids compared to the flowers, they still possess some medicinal value. Leaves are often used to make cannabis-infused products like topical salves and tinctures.

                               </strong>
                                Trichomes are tiny, mushroom-shaped structures found on the surface of cannabis flowers, leaves, and stems. They produce and store the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds that give the plant its unique aroma, flavor, and therapeutic properties.

                               </strong>
                                Cannabis stems are the sturdy, fibrous structures that support the plant's overall framework. They are generally less potent in terms of cannabinoids and are often discarded or used for purposes like making

                                    Seeds:
                                </strong>
                                Cannabis seeds, when mature, have a hard outer shell and can be used for propagation to grow new plants. While seeds do not contain significant levels of cannabinoids, they are valuable for breeding purposes and as a source of nutritious hemp seeds.

                                    Roots:
                                </strong>
                                Cannabis roots play a crucial role in absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, providing stability to the plant. They also serve as a storage site for certain compounds. Although not commonly used, cannabis roots can be brewed to make teas or herbal preparations.

                                These components collectively contribute to the diverse range of applications and uses of the cannabis plant, including recreational and medicinal purposes, fiber production, and more.
                                It should be remembered that cannabis follows human beings all across the earth and is now found on every continent. Humans have used cannabis for both material and medicinal utility and its modern varieties are completely a product of its long-term cultivation.
