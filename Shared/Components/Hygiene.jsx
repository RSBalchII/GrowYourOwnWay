                    When you grow your own garden you are in complete control of your fertilizer and pesticide usage.

                    <strong class="orange">Pesticides</strong> 
                    they come in natural and synthetic versions. 
                    The biggest difference between the two is the method of action. Many organic methods will capture pests to incapacitate and hopefully suffocate them.

                    <strong class="orange">Synthetic pesticides</strong>
                    tend to be concentrated insect harming poisons. While there are organic poisons available as well its best to remember that poisons should  always be used as a last resort to save a harvest as cleaning a plant off of those sprayed on poisons by washing the plant down with water can cultivate mold.

                    <strong class="orange">Mold/Mildew</strong>
                    this is one of the hardest hurdles growers come across. The fungus most commonly afflicting cannabis are 
                    
                    <strong class="orange"> Powdery Mildew</strong> 
                    in the 3rd stage of growth which is characterized by white furry layers first showing up underneath cannabis fan leaves and later covering the majority of fan leaves if left untended.

                    Another common fungus <strong class="orange">Botrytis</strong> 
                    commonly known as "Bud Rot" in the 4th stage of growth which is characterized by black mold forming within the flower
                    
                    <strong class="orange">If we look closer</strong> 
                    there are hundreds of types of mold and mildew that love cannabis plants but all of them will show similar characteristics on the plants should you come across them.
                    
                    <strong class="orange">Timely watering/fertilization</strong> 
                    dry plants can develop diseases and mutations in order to adapt to a dry environment. This can result in smaller plants, smaller flowers, and weaker trichrome production.
