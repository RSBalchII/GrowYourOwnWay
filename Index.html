            <p><strong class="orange">To get started</strong>
                proper planning will save you time and headache down the road. Decisions like
                <br> "How many plants?",
                <br>"What kind of garden will I have?
                <br>Indoor or Outdoor?"
                <br>"What plants am I interested in?"
                <br><br>
                It is always a good idea to determine the
                amount of time you wish to put into a garden as Cannabis is a thirsty plant and to get usable medicine in the end requires dedication and an eye for detail.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Rules of thumb that I live by when considering starting a new cultivation are as follows.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Know the weather and conditions!</strong> You should find tools to measure the humidity of the space(especially for indoor gardens), temperature, and Ph of the water you are using.
                <br><br><strong class="orange">Temperature</strong>
                <br>
                The ideal temperature for cannabis varies slightly over its growth stages. If you grow outside then consider your weather forecasts to determine when to start your cultivation.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Temperature control is only really possible in an enclosed growing environment</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 1</strong> the temperature should be higher than 76 degrees but not higher than 90 degrees f.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 2</strong> you should be finding a balance in between 75 degrees and 85 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 3</strong> will call for lower temperatures close to 76 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 4</strong> will see you wanting to cool them down even more to about 70 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">A proper Ph</strong>
                <br>
                cannabis feeding is between 5.8 and 6.4. You can find amendments to water Ph at your local gardening store.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Coco is easy!</strong>
                <br>
                As a growing medium it is both fairly inexpensive and makes it easy for plants to uptake the available elements in your fertilizer. You can find coco in most gardening stores and I recommend it for beginners.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Support your Plants!</strong>
                <br>
                I recommend setting up your plants either with stakes to hold up heavy branches or a grid trellis system to pull them through and support the plants stems as the buds get heavier. This will also allow the plant to devote more of its limited energies to growing flowers and not stem.
                <br><br>
                Good Luck! Have fun, feel free to use this guide to inform you of next steps!
