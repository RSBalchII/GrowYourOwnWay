                <br><br> <strong class="orange">Synthetic pesticides</strong> <br>tend to be concentrated insect harming poisons. While there are organic poisons available as well its best to remember that poisons should  always be used as a last resort to save a harvest as cleaning a plant off of those sprayed on poisons by washing the plant down with water can cultivate mold.
                <br><br><strong class="orange">Mold/Mildew</strong> <br>this is one of the hardest hurdles growers come across.

                <br><br>
                Another common fungus <strong class="orange">Botrytis</strong> commonly known as "Bud Rot" in the 4th stage of growth which is characterized by black mold forming within the flower

        <p>
            Tending a cannabis garden can be as easy or as difficult as you have the desire to make it. To make the best choices its good to know some basics about the cannabis species and how cannabis is categorized.
            <br><br><strong class="white">Phenotype</strong>
            Cannabis is the genus of the plant commonly used for its psychoactive effects in modern times. Cannabis is often categorized as "Sativa" or "Indica". This perceived difference comes from some characteristics of the psychoactive effects.
            <br><br>
            In order to clear up some confusion around the two <strong class="white">"types"</strong> of cannabis, it is important to know that many modern cultivars are bred with plants from around the world. The genetic growth characteristics could come from a multitude of parents far back in a plants lineage.
            <br><br>
            This means that <strong class="white">"Sativa"</strong> plants are often associated with tall and over long blooming periods. However, the distinction is not so clear between the two types.
            <br><br>
            <strong class="white">"Indica"</strong> plants are believed to grow short and stout and perform well in cold weather This is an over-simplification as some tall plants do well in overly cold environments while some short ones do not.
            <br><br>
            What is important to remember about this is that the types allow for a categorization of psychoactive effects amongst users providing a common language about the products of cannabis cultivation.
            <br><br>
            <strong class="white">"Indica"</strong> effects are considered to be relaxing and slow a user down providing anxiety relief.
            <br>
            <strong class="white">"Sativa"</strong> effects are considered to be more euphoric, energetic, and anxiety inducing.
            <br>
            <strong class="white">"Hybrid"</strong> effects are the result of the aforementioned mash of lineages.
            <br><br>
            The important fact I have come to learn is that each plant will respond according to the genetics its parents provide it with. its prior lineage and phenotype will determine the possible outcomes and only having grown a plant to fruition would a grower truly know how a specific <strong class="white">"phenotype"</strong> grows and what quality of flower it provides.
            <br><br>
            This means that determining outcomes is not as cut and dry as "Sativa" and "Indica" as the genetic  origins of the plant you obtain may well have physical and psychoactive characteristics of either.
            <br><br>
        <p>
            Often with the help of websites such as
            <a class="white" href="https://en.seedfinder.eu/" target="_blank">SeedFinder</a>
            we can look back through the known data of lineages and determine some characteristics of plants we come across.

            <h4 id="Tips">Tips and Tricks!</h4>
            <p><strong class="orange">To get started</strong>
                proper planning will save you time and headache down the road. Decisions like
                <br> "How many plants?",
                <br>"What kind of garden will I have?
                <br>Indoor or Outdoor?"
                <br>"What plants am I interested in?"
                <br><br>
                It is always a good idea to determine the
                amount of time you wish to put into a garden as Cannabis is a thirsty plant and to get usable medicine in the end requires dedication and an eye for detail.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Rules of thumb that I live by when considering starting a new cultivation are as follows.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Know the weather and conditions!</strong> You should find tools to measure the humidity of the space(especially for indoor gardens), temperature, and Ph of the water you are using.
                <br><br><strong class="orange">Temperature</strong>
                <br>
                The ideal temperature for cannabis varies slightly over its growth stages. If you grow outside then consider your weather forecasts to determine when to start your cultivation.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Temperature control is only really possible in an enclosed growing environment</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 1</strong> the temperature should be higher than 76 degrees but not higher than 90 degrees f.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 2</strong> you should be finding a balance in between 75 degrees and 85 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 3</strong> will call for lower temperatures close to 76 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Stage 4</strong> will see you wanting to cool them down even more to about 70 degrees.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">A proper Ph</strong>
                <br>
                cannabis feeding is between 5.8 and 6.4. You can find amendments to water Ph at your local gardening store.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Coco is easy!</strong>
                <br>
                As a growing medium it is both fairly inexpensive and makes it easy for plants to uptake the available elements in your fertilizer. You can find coco in most gardening stores and I recommend it for beginners.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="orange">Support your Plants!</strong>
                <br>
                I recommend setting up your plants either with stakes to hold up heavy branches or a grid trellis system to pull them through and support the plants stems as the buds get heavier. This will also allow the plant to devote more of its limited energies to growing flowers and not stem.
                <br><br>
                Good Luck! Have fun, feel free to use this guide to inform you of next steps!
